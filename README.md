# SLAM Evaluator
Evaluator to save and compare results from different SLAM algorithms/commits.

## How does it work?
Run the ``record_folder.py`` script found in the scripts folder.
This will run the ``record_bag.launch`` where you can specify via the ``config`` folder which algorithm and parameters are you using.
****Important:**** the algorithms have to detect when the bag ends and *end naturally* in order to work.
